### The Challenge
Zinc Oxide (ZnO) is a promising photocatalyst for water purification, but its efficiency is limited by rapid electron-hole recombination.

### The Innovation: Chemical Hardness Tuning
I hypothesized that doping ZnO with "Chemically Hard" elements (like $Al^{3+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$) would improve the adsorption of hard species like water and oxygen, thereby enhancing catalytic turnover.

### Key Findings
* **Morphology Tuning:** Aliovalent doping ($Al^{3+}$) transformed ZnO from Nanorods to Nanoparticles due to polarity-induced growth modulation.
* **Performance:** **Al-ZnO** achieved a **91.25% degradation rate** of Methyl Orange (MO) dye, compared to just 40% for pure ZnO.
* **Correlation:** Established a direct trend between the **Pearson Hardness** of the dopant and photocatalytic activity: $Al > Sr > Cr > Ni > Zn$.
