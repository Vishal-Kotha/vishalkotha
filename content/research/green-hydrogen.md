### 1. Chiral-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS)
At the Weizmann Institute, I investigated the role of electron spin in water splitting. By coating Nickel electrodes with chiral molecules, we achieved a **10% increase** in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) efficiency.

### 2. Novel Synthesis: Dynamic Hydrothermal (DH)
Standard hydrothermal methods often yield large, uncontrolled crystals due to diffusion limitations. To solve this, I developed a proprietary **"Dynamic Hydrothermal" (DH)** protocol involving in-situ stirring at high temperatures ($265^{\circ}C$).

* **The Breakthrough:** This process successfully stabilized **LKMO Nanorods** and truncated cubes—morphologies that were previously impossible to achieve via static methods.
* **Why it Matters:** High-aspect-ratio nanorods provide ideal pathways for electron transport, crucial for next-gen device applications.

### 3. Single Nanorod Device Fabrication
To understand the intrinsic transport properties of these nanorods, I fabricated single-particle devices.

#### Fabrication Protocol
1.  **Dispersal:** Nanorods were dispersed on $Si/SiO_2$ wafers with alignment markers.
2.  **Lithography:** Used **Electron-Beam Lithography (EBL)** to pattern sub-100nm contacts on individual rods.
3.  **Deposition:** Orion Sputtering was used to deposit Pt/Au contacts.

#### Results
* **Yield:** Achieved an **80% device yield rate** through optimized resist baking and development protocols.
* **Transport Physics:** The devices allowed us to characterize the metal-semiconductor junction and carrier mobility in perovskite nanostructures.
