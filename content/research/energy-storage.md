### The Challenge
Zinc-air batteries are a promising alternative to Lithium-ion, but they suffer from sluggish oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Commercial catalysts like Platinum (Pt) are expensive and unstable.

### 1. Synthesis: The "Black Powder" Challenge
Incorporating volatile alkali metals (like Potassium) into the Perovskite lattice is notoriously difficult due to their high vapor pressure at calcination temperatures ($>800^{\circ}C$). 

I solved this by developing a **low-temperature ($265^{\circ}C$) hydrothermal route**, effectively "trapping" the Potassium ions within the lattice.

### 2. Advanced Characterization (PFM)
To verify the ferroelectric domains and surface potential, I conducted **Piezo-Force Microscopy (PFM)** on individual microcubes.

### 3. Battery Performance (Zinc-Air)
I applied these microcubes as the air-cathode catalyst in a rechargeable Zinc-Air battery.

* **Bifunctionality:** The catalyst showed a half-wave onset potential of **0.78 V** for ORR and an onset potential of **1.66 V** for OER.
* **Stability:** The battery operated for **1000 cycles (100 hours)** with **no visible sign of degradation**, outperforming traditional catalysts.

### 4. Beyond Batteries: Organocatalysis
In a separate study, I extended the utility of LKMO to the **pharmaceutical sector**.

* **Application:** Selective reduction of $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (Chalcones).
* **The Win:** Achieved **100% conversion** at 120°C/7 bar $H_2$, outperforming standard $LaSrMnO_3$ (LSMO).
* **The Science:** The K-substitution exposes active $Mn$ sites on the surface, whereas Sr-substitution tends to form an inert $SrO$ passivation layer.
