I am a **Materials Scientist** and **Data Engineer** dedicated to bridging the gap between atomic-level design and real-world energy applications. With a Ph.D. from **IIT Bombay** and postdoctoral experience at the **Weizmann Institute of Science**, I specialize in synthesizing transition metal perovskite oxides for green hydrogen and next-gen batteries.

### My Philosophy: "Conscious Science"

My approach to research is grounded in the belief that **precision in the laboratory begins with precision of the mind.**

In 2024, I undertook a focused sabbatical at the **Isha Foundation** to cultivate mental clarity and operational resilience. This was not a pause from science, but a recalibration of the scientist.

I discovered that the rigorous discipline required to **synthesize phase-pure $LaMnO_3$** or **manipulate chiral spin selectivity** is mirrored by the internal discipline required to lead complex R&D projects. I now bring this enhanced capacity for **high-pressure decision-making, cross-disciplinary empathy, and operational focus** back to the laboratory, offering a leadership style that is as robust as the materials I engineer.

### Technical Expertise

**1. Synthesis & Fabrication**
* **Hydrothermal & Sol-Gel:** Expert in tailoring nucleation kinetics for Perovskites ($LaMnO_3$, $LaFeO_3$).
* **Nanofabrication:** Electron-Beam Lithography (EBL) and Sputtering, achieving 80% device yield.
* **Mechanochemistry:** Scalable synthesis of bimetallic chalcogenides.

**2. Advanced Characterization**
* **Microscopy:** 500+ hours on FEG-TEM and SEM-EDS.
* **Spectroscopy:** XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) and Rietveld Refinement for crystal structure analysis.

**3. Data Engineering**
* **Computational:** DFT calculations (VASP, Gaussian) for molecular modeling.
* **Digital:** Python and SQL for research data management and process automation.
