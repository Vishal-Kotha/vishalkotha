title: "Professional Experience"
date: 2025-12-03Postdoctoral Fellow | Weizmann Institute of ScienceRehovot, Israel | 2023 – 2024Chiral Catalysis: Pioneered chirality induction in Ni-Au systems for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER). Achieved a 10% efficiency improvement for green fuel applications.1Advanced Characterization: Utilized TEM and XPS to correlate structural chirality with catalytic activity.Collaboration: Worked with international, multidisciplinary teams to demonstrate superior HER activity.Postdoctoral Fellow | IIT BombayMumbai, India | 2022 – 2023Magneto-Electric Effects: Investigated water electrolysis using $La_2FeMnO_6$, advancing multi-ferroic catalysts.1Mechanochemistry: Conducted shear-induced nucleation and exfoliation of nanomaterials for scalable synthesis.Ph.D. Researcher | IIT BombayMumbai, India | 2016 – 2022Thesis: Tailoring Transition Metal Perovskite Oxides via Low-Temperature Hydrothermal Routes.Key Achievement: Led hydrothermal synthesis of K-substituted $LaMnO_3$ perovskite for zinc-air batteries, resulting in 3 high-impact publications.1Mentorship: Trained 4 students and logged 500+ hours on characterization tools (FEG-TEM, SEM).Insight: Note the use of LaTeX syntax $La_2FeMnO_6$ for chemical formulas.
