### Engineering Contact Architectures
My research often requires probing the intrinsic electrical properties of novel nanomaterials. This necessitates the fabrication of custom device architectures that minimize contact resistance and allow for precise Hall measurement.

Extracting intrinsic properties from 2D materials and thin films requires more than just placing probes. It requires designing contacts that are **Ohmic**, **low-resistance**, and **mechanically stable**.

I manage the full clean-room workflow: specialize in **Electron Beam Lithography (EBL)** and **Photolithography** to define sub-micron contacts on sensitive 1D & 2D materials and perovskite thin films.

### Case Study: The "5-Probe" Hall Bar
**The Problem:** Standard 4-probe measurements often suffer from mixing of longitudinal ($R_{xx}$) and transverse ($R_{xy}$) voltage components due to geometric misalignment.

**The Solution:**
I designed and fabricated a custom **5-Probe Asymmetric Hall Bar** using Electron Beam Lithography.
* **Design:** The asymmetric probe placement allows for simultaneous measurement of Hall Voltage ($V_H$) and Longitudinal Voltage ($V_L$) without geometric crosstalk.
* **Fabrication:** 1.  Substrate cleaning (Piranha etch).
    2.  EBL Patterning (PMMA resist).
    3.  Metal Deposition (Ti/Au via E-beam evaporation).
    4.  Lift-off.
