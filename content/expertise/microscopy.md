### Probing the Ångström Scale
In energy storage, "defects" are often the active sites. My research utilizes **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** to move beyond bulk average structures (XRD) and visualize local atomic arrangements.

### Case Study: Stacking Faults in NiFe-LDH
In my work on *NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxides*, we observed anomalously high battery-type capacity. 
**Hypothesis:** Structural disorder was creating additional intercalation pathways.

**Technique:**
I employed **High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM)** and **Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED)** to map the lattice.
* **Observation:** The lattice fringes revealed turbostratic disorder (rotational misalignment) between the hydroxide layers.
* **Outcome:** This disorder reduced the diffusion barrier for electrolyte ions, directly explaining the superior rate capability.
