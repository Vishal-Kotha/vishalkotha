### Beyond Bulk Characterization
In energy materials, "imperfections" are often the feature, not the bug. My expertise lies in using **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** to correlate local atomic disorder with macroscopic performance.

### Technique: Lattice Fringe Analysis
In my research on Perovskite oxides, I employed High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) to confirm crystallinity and phase purity.

* **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** By converting real-space images to reciprocal space (FFT patterns), I verified the single-crystalline nature of the synthesized nanostructures.
* **d-spacing Measurement:** Precisely measured interplanar distances (e.g., ~$0.27$ nm corresponding to the (110) plane).

### Case Study: Stacking Faults in NiFe-LDH
*From recent work on Battery-Type Supercapacitors.*

**Observation:** We observed anomalously high capacity in specific batches of Nickel-Iron Layered Double Hydroxides (NiFe-LDH).
**Analysis:** High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) revealed that the layers were not perfectly stacked.
* **Evidence:** Lattice fringe analysis showed **"turbostratic disorder"** (rotational misalignment) between the hydroxide sheets.
* **Impact:** This disorder expanded the interlayer spacing, reducing the diffusion barrier for electrolyte ions and enabling high-rate performance.
