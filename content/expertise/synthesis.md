### Tuning Morphology via Soft Chemistry
The functionality of a nanomaterial is dictated by its shape and facet exposure. My expertise lies in **Hydrothermal Synthesis**, using pressure and pH as levers to control crystal growth kinetics.

### Case Study: $WO_3$ Nanorods
For aqueous Zn-ion batteries, we required an anode with high surface area and structural stability.
* **Method:** Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves at 180°C.
* **Control:** By adjusting the precursor pH, I directed the growth along the [001] direction, resulting in uniform nanorods rather than irregular plates.
* **Result:** These nanorods exhibited excellent cycle stability (over 1000 cycles) due to effective strain relaxation during Zn2+ insertion.
