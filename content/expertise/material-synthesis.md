### Tuning the Phase and Morphology
The performance of energy materials is dictated by their crystal structure. My synthesis expertise focuses on **Hydrothermal** and **Solvothermal** methods, where pressure and temperature are used as levers to tune the phase of transition metal oxides (e.g., $LaMnO_3$, $WO_3$).

### High-Pressure Synthesis
I utilize Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclaves (shown below) to conduct reactions at temperatures up to 220°C. This specific setup allows for:
* **Dopant Integration:** Introducing K+ or Na+ ions into the lattice.
* **Morphology Control:** Guiding the growth of nanowires vs. nanoplates by adjusting the precursor pH.
