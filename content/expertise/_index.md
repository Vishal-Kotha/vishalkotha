## 💻 Computational & Data Stack
While my core expertise is experimental, I leverage a robust computational stack to accelerate data analysis and visualization.

* **Simulation:** Density Functional Theory (DFT) using **VASP** & **Gaussian**.
* **Analysis:** **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib) for automated data plotting and crystallography scripting.
* **Database:** **SQL** for managing large-scale experimental datasets (XRD/XPS libraries).
