### Philosophy: The "Why" Before the "How"
In modern academia, education often prioritizes *procedure* over *principle*—teaching students how to run an instrument before they understand why the measurement matters.

My mentorship philosophy at **Isha Home School, Isha Samskriti** and **IIT Bombay** focuses on cultivating **Scientific Temperament**: the ability to question, hypothesize, and accept failure as data.

### Key Mentorship Pillars

**1. Resilience in Failure**
Research is 90% failure. I train undergraduates to view a "failed" experiment not as a dead end, but as a diagnostic tool.
* *Impact:* Mentored students who successfully troubleshooted complex synthesis protocols by systematically eliminating variables rather than blindly repeating steps.

**2. First-Principles Thinking**
I encourage students to derive solutions from fundamental laws.
* *Example:* Instead of memorizing the Hall Effect formula, we derive it from the Lorentz Force to understand *why* carrier type affects the voltage sign.

**3. The Art of Communication**
Data is useless if it cannot be communicated. I lead workshops on **Scientific Writing** and **Data Visualization**, teaching researchers how to craft a compelling narrative around their findings.
