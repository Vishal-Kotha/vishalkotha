### The Philosophy of Science Education
Science is not just about data acquisition; it is about cultivating a mindset of inquiry. My experience at **Isha Vidhya** involved mentoring undergraduate students, helping them bridge the gap between textbook theory and experimental reality.

### Key Initiatives
* **Curriculum Development:** Designed hands-on modules for understanding basic electronics and material properties.
* **Resilience Training:** Mentored students on handling experimental failure—a critical skill for any researcher.
* **Technical Workshops:** Led sessions on "The Art of Scientific Writing" and data visualization.
