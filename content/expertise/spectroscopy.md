### The Surface is the Stage
In electrocatalysis, the bulk formula doesn't matter as much as the surface state. To understand *why* my K-substituted Perovskites outperformed standard catalysts, I had to probe the top few nanometers of the material.

**1. X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)**
* **The Query:** Did Potassium substitution actually change the manganese oxidation state?
* **The Analysis:** I performed high-resolution deconvolution of the **Mn 2p** spectra.
* **The Finding:** The spectra revealed a shift in the $Mn^{3+}/Mn^{4+}$ ratio. The incorporation of $K^+$ created significant **$Mn^{4+}$ surface defects**, which act as the primary active sites for oxygen adsorption during the ORR process.

**2. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)**
* **The Query:** Is the catalyst inherently faster, or just more conductive?
* **The Analysis:** I modeled the Nyquist plots using a Randles equivalent circuit.
* **The Finding:** The K-substituted samples showed a drastically reduced **Charge Transfer Resistance ($R_{ct}$)** compared to the pristine sample, confirming faster electron transfer kinetics at the electrode-electrolyte interface.
