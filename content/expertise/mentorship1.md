### Philosophy: The "Why" Before the "How"
Science education often focuses on the "how"—how to run an experiment, how to plot data. My mentorship philosophy focuses on the "why." At **Isha Vidhya**, I worked with undergraduate students to build **Scientific Temperament**.

### Key Mentorship Pillars
1.  **Resilience in Failure:** Teaching students that a "failed" experiment is often a finding in disguise.
2.  **First-Principles Thinking:** Encouraging students to derive solutions from fundamental laws rather than rote memorization.
3.  **Communication:** Training researchers to communicate complex data through clear, compelling narratives.
