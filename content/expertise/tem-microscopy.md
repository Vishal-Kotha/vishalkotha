### The Challenge: Seeing the Invisible
In energy storage materials, performance is often dictated by defects that exist on the Ångström scale. Bulk characterization (like XRD) gives an average picture, but it cannot explain why two chemically identical samples perform differently.

My expertise lies in using **Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)** to correlate local atomic structure with macroscopic device performance.

### Case Study: Interlayer Anions in NiFe-LDH
**The Problem:** We synthesized NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxides (LDH) for supercapacitors, but specific synthesis batches showed anomalously high capacity.
**The Hypothesis:** We suspected that "stacking faults"—errors in the layering sequence—were creating extra active sites.

**The Solution:**
I utilized High-Resolution TEM (HRTEM) to image the lattice fringes directly.
* **Technique:** Bright Field Imaging & Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED).
* **Result:** The imaging revealed distinct "turbostratic" disorder (rotational misalignment) between layers, which facilitated faster ion diffusion.
