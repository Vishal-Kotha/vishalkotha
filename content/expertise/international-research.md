### Cross-Border Collaboration
Science has no borders. My time at the **Weizmann Institute of Science** (Israel) exposed me to a high-octane research environment where interdisciplinary collaboration is the norm. Working with diverse teams taught me to integrate different scientific perspectives—from theoretical physics to solid-state chemistry—into a cohesive research narrative.

### Research Focus: Solar Energy
During this tenure, I focused on advanced spectroscopic techniques to understand charge carrier dynamics in photovoltaic materials.
