title: "Vishal Kotha" description: "Ph.D. in Chemistry | IIT Bombay"
Professional Summary
I am a Materials Scientist with a Ph.D. in Chemistry from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, specializing in the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials. With over 7 years of research experience, my work bridges the gap between fundamental materials chemistry and scalable energy applications.

My research interests include:

Nanofabrication: Lithography (electron & photo), ALD, CVD.

Electrocatalysis: Developing chiral Ni-Au systems for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER).   

Characterization: Proficient in FEG-TEM, SEM-EDS, PXRD, and XPS.

Currently, I am exploring the societal impact of science through a sabbatical at the Isha Foundation, enhancing project management skills in dynamic environments.
